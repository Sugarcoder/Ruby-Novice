puts "Hello, world!"

# Kernel = a special type of class packed full of standard, commonly used methods, making codes easier to read and write.
# Ex. "puts" is a method from the Kernel module.


# "1.puts" = a kernel method included and searched by default, so you don't need to use "kernel.puts".

# "2.puts" = takes only one argument (a discrete item of data passed to a method - aka "parameter") and rarely followed by other methods or logic, so parentheses are not strictly necessary.
 
 
 
# All of these lines of code are functionally equivalent:
# Kernel.puts("Hello, world!")
# Kernel.puts "Hello, world!"
# puts("Hello, world!")
# puts "Hello, world!"

# The data above ("hello, world") is being passed to Kernel.puts but each style is different.
