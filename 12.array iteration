# Iterating arrays uses the "each" method.

# "Each" method goes through each element of the array and passes it as a parameter to the code block you entered.

# Examples: 

[1, "test", 2,3,4].each { |element| puts element.to_s + "X"}     
# The answer will be " 1X  testX  2X  3X  4X


[1,2,3,4].collect { |element| element * 2}  
# The answer will be [2,4,6,8]
