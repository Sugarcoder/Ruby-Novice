# If you have 2 arrays, you can combine them into one. 

x = [1,2,3]
y = ["a", "b", "c"]
z = x + y     # OR you can do "z = x - y" and it will subtract

p z            # Answer will be [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"]





# To check if an array is empty or not:

x = []
puts "x is empty" if x.empty?      # Answer will be "x is empty because nothing is in [ ].




# To check if a certain element is in the string:

x = [1,2,3]
p x.include?("a")   # Answer is FALSE because there is no "a" in the string.
p x.include?(3)      # Answer is TRUE because 3 is in the string.





# To access the first and last element in the array: 

x = ["candy, land"]
puts x.first           # Answer is "candy"
puts x.last            # Answer is "land"




# This example passes a numeric parameter from the start to the end.
# You'll get the number of items from the start to end of the array:

x = [1,2,3,4,5]
puts x.first(4).join("-")        


# Answer will be 1-2-3-4, because you are asking for the first 4 elements.




# To reverse an array:

x = [1,2,3,4,5]
p x.reverse      # Answer will be [5,4,3,2,1]
