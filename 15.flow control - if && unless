# "If" and "Unless" is used to perform difference operations based on their circumstances.


# Example of IF:

age = 10 
puts "You are not an adult yet." if age < 18
end

# Answer will be "You are not an adult yet."




age = 15
puts "You are still a teenager." if age > 12 && age < 18
end 


# Answer will be "You are still a teenager." 







# UNLESS (Unless you want something else to happen): 


# If you put "exit" before "end", the program will close itself. 

# Examples: 


age = 20
unless age >= 21
puts "You are not 21 yet."
puts "Therefore, you cannot drink alcohol, so we will close this program now. Good bye."
exit
end





age = 19
  if age < 21
  puts "You are not old enough to drink in the U.S."

  if age > 21
  puts "You are old enough to drink in the U.S. Go party!"
  end 
end

# Answer will be "You are not old enough to drink in the U.S." because age is 19.







# IF and UNLESS also supply the ELSE condition.
# Example: 

age = 17
if age < 18
puts "You are not 18 yet."
else 
puts "You are over 18."
end

# Answer will be "You are not 18 yet."
