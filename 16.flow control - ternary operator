# Ternary operator ( ? ) = allows an expression to contain a mini if/else statement.
# <condition> ? <result if condition is true>  : <result if condition is false>

# Example: 

age = 16 
type = age < 18 ? "teen" : "adult"        # Answer is "teen" after you press Enter
puts "You are a " + type               
# "type" refers to a variable (in this case, "teen"). Answer will be "You are a teen."





# Using UNLESS:

age = 10 
type = "child" if age < 18
type = "adult" unless age < 18
puts "You are a " + type       # Answer will be "You are a child"





# Using ELSE:

age = 10 
  if age < 18
    type = 'child'
  else 
    type = 'adult' 
end
puts "You are a " + type     # Answer will be "You are a child" 





# Using Ternary Operator on a single line:

age = 10
puts "You are a " + (age < 18 ? "child" : "adult")
# Answer is "You are a child"
