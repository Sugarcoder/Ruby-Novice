# Making several comparisons using the same variable:

fruit = "apple"
color = "red" if fruit == "apple"
color = "yellow" if fruit == "banana"
color = "orange" if fruit == "orange"





# Using ELSIF: 

fruit = "apple" 
if fruit == "apple"
  color = "red"
if fruit == "banana"
  color = "yellow" 
if fruit == "orange" 
  color = "orange"
else
  color = "no clue"
end


# ELSIF is similar to ELSE, except ELSIF creates a whole new comparison expression. 





# Variant of using ELSIF: 

fruit = "apple"

case fruit
when "apple" 
color = "red"
when "banana"
color = "yellow"
when "lime"
color = "green"
  else 
  color = "no clue"
end

# Answer will be "red" because the fruit is apple.





# CASE Shortcut:

fruit = "apple" 
color = case fruit

when "apple"
  "red"
when "banana"
  "yellow"
when "lime"
  "green"
else
  "no clue"
end

# Answer will be "red".
