# WHILE and UNTIL allows you to loop code based on the result of a comparison made on each loop.


# Example of WHILE: 

x = 10 
while x < 100
puts x
x = x * 2
end

# Answer will be "10, 20, 40, 80"






# UNTIL loops until a certain condition is met. 


# Example of UNTIL:

x = 20
until x > 120
puts x
x = x * 2
end

# Answer will be "20, 40, 80"






# Using WHILE and UNTIL in a single line:

a = 5
a = a * 2 until a > 100
puts a

# Answer will be 160.
