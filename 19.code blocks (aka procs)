# EACH method accepts a single code block and runs each element of the array.
# The code block is defined within { } or "do" / "end"

# You can write your own methods to handle code blocks. 


# each_vowel = a method that accepts a code block.


# yield vowel = automatically detects any passed code block and passes control to it.



# Example: 

def each_vowel 
  %w{a e i o u}.each { |vowel| yield vowel}
end

each_vowel { |vowel| puts vowel} 

# Answer will be "aeiou => ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]





# Only one code block can be passed at a time.

# Code blocks may accept none, one or more parameters themselves. 




# You can store code blocks within variables (using the lambda method): 

# Example:

print_parameter_to_screen = lambda { |x| puts x}
print_parameter_to_screen.call(100)

# Answer will be 100
