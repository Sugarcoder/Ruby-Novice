# How chess was created...


rice_on_square = 1
64.times do |square|
  puts "On square #{square + 1} are
#{rice_on_square} grain(s)"
  rice_on_square += 2
end


# Answer will be:
# On square 1 are 1 grain(s)
# On square 2 are 2 grain(s)...





# Fixnum = represents easily managed (small) numbers

# Bignum = represents big numbers 

# Example for Bignum: 

puts 34628362846293.class      # Result will be "Bignum"
