# Numbers belong to Fixnum, Bignum, Float and integer classes.

# "String" are objects of the String class.

# Symbols are objects of the Symbol class.



# A number can become a string, a string can become a number.

# Example: 

puts "12" + "10"       # Answer will be 1210
puts 12 + 10           # Answer will be 22



# Converting objects to classes:


puts "12".to_i + "10".to_i            # Answer will be 22
puts 12.to_s + 10.to_s                # Answer will be 1210 




# The String class provides the "to_i" and "to_f" methods. 

# to_f = Float


# to_sym = converts a string into a Symbol.

# to_s = converts a symbol into a String
