# All strings in Ruby are objects of the "String" class.
# Ex. puts "Hello, Princess".class


x = "Love"
y = "you"
puts "I love you" if x + y == "Loveyou"



# This is how you include multiple lines of text. 

x = %q{My name is Princess Ruby
and I rule all of Ruby Kingdom!}


# you can also use < >, ( ), and ! ! instead of { }.


# If you use "<<", then it will come out with each word beginning with \n.

# Example: 
x = <<TEST_ONLY
This is only 
a test.
TEST_ONLY



# You can also multiply or use operators for strings.

# Example:
puts "Candy" * 5
puts "x" > "y"     # Answer is False
puts "y" > "x"     # Answer is True
