# "person_instance" is a VARIABLE.
# "Person" is a CLASS.
# attr = attribute (Ex. age, gender)
# accessor = Makes the attributes accessible
# end = Tells Ruby I am done defining this
# puts = Automatically moves the output cursor to the next line
# inheritance = Allows different classes to relate to one another and group concepts by their similarities.
# Ex. Put "Cats", "Dogs", "Pandas" into one class (Pets). Allows the other animals to "inherit" the features that all pets have.
